## 🧩 My Projects

Here you can find some of the projects I’ve worked on. Each one represents a real problem solved with code (because programming is basically life, but with bugs).

## 🚀 FeedbackNet (Fullstack App)

FeedbackNet is a fullstack web application for managing **PQR/S** (Petitions, Complaints, Claims, and Suggestions).
It provides authentication, role-based access, request lifecycle tracking, and real-time responses.

## 🤝 Collaborations and Contributions
I haven't contributed to open source projects yet, but I'm eager to start. I'd love to get involved in AI projects and continue exploring backend development, especially in the cloud.

## 🎢 Hobbies and Fun Facts
- **Speed**: One of my big dreams is to experience going over 350 kilometers per hour.
- **Entertainment**: I enjoy movies, anime, and music.
- **Programming**: I love doing new things with code.

### Anecdotes
Ah, the classic forgotten semicolon... 😅 More than once, I've spent hours debugging only to discover that I missed a semicolon or had a typo. Programming always has its challenges!
